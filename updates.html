              <h2>Consistency</h2>
              <p>As I mentioned previously, consistency is key when trying to develop a skill. Even though content of these updates may seem minimal, any knowledge gained and put into practice is another step towards mastery, and consistency as well as discipine are muscles that must be trained like any other. I would like to write more, as it is something I used to greatly enjoy, and even excelled at. I wonder if I may have a little section where I review movies, or games, or just give my thoughts about a topic I have found interest in. I have added my first written article, about writing Cover Letters.</p>

            <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
            <p>Creating a personal website and portfolio has been a project I have put off for a long time, with justifications that made sense at the time. I would like this to be a place for me to demonstrate past works, my current endeavors, and my future plans. I have many different ideas I want to explore, and I believe that thoroughly detailing them will benefit me, and may prove informative for...someone! Maybe. I will test the prism javascript highlighter now.</p>

            <h3>Current Plans</h3>
            <p>I would like my work here to be consistent so I can see my progress in real time. As I learn new skills I want to document them here for my own posterity and so they might help someone else. Some ideas I would like to pursue, listed from least to most complex:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a style guide for this website</li>
              <li>Write my first ever guide to something, no matter how small</li>
              <li>Write a python script that takes a written article and formats it into a html snippet like this. Not sure this is worth the time...</li>
              <li>Format site to work on mobile</li>
              <li>Learn about and implement Group Policies for VM simulated clients</li>
              <li>Experiment with the MERN stack...many things I would like to create</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Just writing these ideas down is energizing. The most daunting step is the first one; consistency will make everything after that much easier.</p>
