                  <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
                  <p>Creating a personal website and portfolio has been a project I have put off for a long time, with justifications that made sense at the time. I would like this to be a place for me to demonstrate past works, my current endeavors, and my future plans. I have many different ideas I want to explore, and I believe that thoroughly detailing them will benefit me, and may prove informative for...someone! Maybe. I will test the prism javascript highlighter now.</p>
                  <pre><code class="language-css">test { result: did it work? } </code></pre>
                  <h3>Current Plans</h3>
                  <p>I would like my work here to be consistent so I can see my progress in real time. As I learn new skills I want to document them here for my own posterity and so they might help someone else. Some ideas I would like to pursue, listed from least to most complex:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create a style guide for this website</li>
                    <li>Write my first ever guide to something, no matter how small</li>
                    <li>Write a python script that takes a written article and formats it into a html snippet like this. Not sure this is worth the time...</li>
                    <li>Format site to work on mobile</li>
                    <li>Learn about and implement Group Policies for VM simulated clients</li>
                    <li>Experiment with the MERN stack...many things I would like to create</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Just writing these ideas down is energizing. The most daunting step is the first one; consistency will make everything after that much easier.</p>

                  <h2>Lorum Ipsum</h2>
                  <p>generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
