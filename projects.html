              <p>Creating a personal website and portfolio has been a project I have put off for a long time, with justifications that made sense at the time. I would like this to be a place for me to demonstrate past works, my current endeavors, and my future plans. I have many different ideas I want to explore, and I believe that thoroughly detailing them will benefit me, and may prove informative for...someone! Maybe. I will test the prism javascript highlighter now.</p>
